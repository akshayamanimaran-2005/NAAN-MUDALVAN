ABSTRACT:
        This project aims to develop a robust speech-to-text system that accurately 
transcribes spoken language in noisy environments and across diverse 
accents. By addressing challenges like background noise and homophones, 
the system seeks to improve transcription accuracy in real-world 
applications. The goal is to enhance the performance of speech recognition 
for virtual assistants, transcription services, and customer support. This 
approach ensures more reliable and effective speech-to-text conversion in 
variedÂ scenarios.
